00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.040
the expeditionary Communicator came from

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.080
the 2018 common outs planning guidance

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.680
it's an answer to what is the

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.840
communicator of the future the

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.880
expeditionary Communications course or

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.599
the ECC is a 56 day course that is

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:28.240
designed to make corporals through gruny

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.279
sergeants proficient in the 0600

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:32.520
occupational field Marines are trained

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.160
in the execution of each element of

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.879
communications and how these skills

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:37.200
apply to force

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.259
[Applause]

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.360
design the ECC has five phases Each of

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.680
which teaches the core discipline of

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.399
communications making Marines more

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.640
effective in their

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.079
craft the first phase teaches Marines to

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:53.039
plan and Implement command control

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.840
Communications and computers in the

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.239
expeditionary advanc based operations

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.239
environment R to learn about the ever

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:00.879
growing capability of communication

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:03.280
systems and emerging

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.640
Technologies the second phase focuses

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.040
equipping Marines with the skills to

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.119
effectively carry out a C2 architecture

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.240
by teaching configuring implementing and

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.880
maintaining small form factor Network

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.320
and Data Systems Marines also be trained

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.000
in the network fundamentals integrating

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.439
into the global Network and their

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:20.360
crucial role in facilitating critical

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.479
information

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:24.560
exchange third and fourth phase give

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.159
Marines an understanding of how narrow

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.280
band and wideband transmission systems

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.680
operate and what they're capable of

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.079
Marines will get the chance to work with

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:33.720
both Cutting Edge gear and commercial

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.360
offthe shelf or C systems making Marines

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.280
ready to perform in warfare's harshest

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.479
environments in Final Phase students

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.000
integrate each core discipline to show

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.560
Mastery in the art of planning

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.479
installing operating and maintaining a

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.600
C2 infrastructure this will ensures

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.159
students can properly integrate systems

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.799
of Communications in a tactical

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:54.040
Operation Center an essential component

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.920
of any combat

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.000
operation come be part of the future of

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.320
War fighting in the Marine Corps and

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.399
further your beyond your field the

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:05.799
expeditionary Communications course
